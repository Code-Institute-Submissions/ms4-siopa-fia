### Validation

- [W3 HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) Results:

![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/elerel/image/upload/v1627549562/w3HTMLchecker_px7ncd.png)

The error showing was in regards to the type attribute under the postblockjs section (toasts) in the base.html page- I later removed this and it made no difference to the code.

- [W3 Jigsaw CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) Results:

![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/elerel/image/upload/v1627550328/cssvalidation_hfhkp5.png)

Two errors were displayed upon results showing- I wasn't overly concerned about this since they are originating from the Bootstrap CDN and would be out of my control.

- [JSHint:](https://jshint.com/)

![image]https://res.cloudinary.com/elerel/image/upload/v1627551061/jshint_cpa9z3.png)

Just the one error here regarding the missing semi-colon (line 119 in stripe-elements.js) which I subsequently added and no further errors followed.

- [PEP8:](http://pep8online.com/)

![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/elerel/image/upload/v1627554718/pep8_q7qj4z.png)

The screenshot above shows the main issues that popped up across several views.py pages- I made sure to address these and no further errors were displayed.

### Performance

Lighthouse Testing:

- Added the suggested attribute 'rel="noreferrer"' to each of the anchor tags to improve the best practices score:

- To improve optimization, I included the word "unsubscribe" in the anchor tag  so the user knows where the link directs:

The other notes included in the lighthouse testing included how the site failed the PWA (progressive Web Apps) instability requirements, which I ignored for now.

### Chrome Developer Tools
I used Chrome Developer Tools very often to check the responsivity across several devices, to check the console for any errors and preview any changes that could be made.

# Bugs
1. Size not displaying in the shopping bag:

![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/elerel/image/upload/v1628075226/sizebug2_nnoeex.png)

Resolved: <strong>Yes.</strong>
On the product_detail.html page, I soon understood the importance of how the name field had to match exactly the value field as set out in the backend. To resolve, I simply removed the whitespace that was causing the issue and the sizes then displayed as they should:

Sizes now correctly displaying:

Other bugs:

-  Through the Heroku deployed site, the sizes only show "N/A" while from gitpod, it    renders no problem. Once the user arrives at the checkout page, the sizes are then displayed as well as in the checkout success page and confirmation email.
Fix? Yes- changed all items that require has_sizes to yes- some were incorrectly labelled as "no".

- Unsubscribe link not displaying (its in a text file, may need to change this to a html file instead?) Fixed: removed the anchor tag and replaced with just hte simple unsubscribe url


Other changes made before during production:
- Removed the two decimals from rating- looked better with a simple decimal point

- When checkout success page url is copied and pasted into a new browser, it is on display- wanted to avoid this so added an if statement to prevent another user from viewing this sensitive information

### Known Bugs:

### Manual Testing

Testing has been primarily and regualrly carried across my own desktop on a Windows 10 Home 20H2 Edition, 64 bit and on my mobile phone, a Samsung Galaxy A50.

Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Microsoft Edge, iOS and Samsung Internet were the browsers used to test all pages. The chart below reflects the results:
